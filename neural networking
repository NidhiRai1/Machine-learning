their are different hiddden layer(type is dense layer) in the neural net , named layer 1 , 2...... , layer 0 is the input layer and the last layer is the output layer
we have learned by forwared propogation with examples like digits/handwritting recogonation 
//tenserflow is one of the laeding framework to implement deep learning algorithum
x = np.array([200.0 , 290.0])
layer_1 = dense(unit = 3 , activation = 'sigmoid')
a1 = layer_1(x)
layer_2 = dense(unit = 1 , activation = 'sigmoid')
a2 = layer_2(a1)
model = seqential(layer_1 , layer_2) //after line 5 and 7
 seqential([dense(unit 3 , activation = 'sigmoid'),dense(unit 1 , activation = 'sigmoid')]) //avoid all the above line an d write this

//how to trsain the model -
1.specify the model which tell tensser flow how to compute for inference
2.compile the model using specific loss function
3.train the model
